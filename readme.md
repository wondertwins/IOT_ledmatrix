###### Internet Connected Led Matrix

## Introduction
> This LED matrix code has been made in two sizes a 100 pixel size and a 256 pixel size. Both are able to fetch data from the web and display things such as local time and weather, tweets, news and so much more! They are also able to display a vairety of animations and gifs. 

## Important Libraries

> The most important part of an LED matrix is being able to drive the LEDs! I used both the very popular FastLed libarary and the Adarafruit Neopixel libarary to cordinate the colors of my WS2812b indiviualy accesiblae LEDs. 

## Important Hardware

> The installation instructions are low priority in the readme and should come at the bottom. The first part answers all their objections and now that they want to use it, show them how.
